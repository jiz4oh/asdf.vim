# asdf.vim

It tells recent versions of [vim-ruby][] where your Ruby
installs are located, so that it can set `'path'` and [`'tags'`][rbenv-ctags]
in your Ruby buffers to reflect the nearest `.tool-version` or `.ruby-version` or file.

[vim-ruby]: https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/jiz4oh/asdf.vim.git

## Inspiration
